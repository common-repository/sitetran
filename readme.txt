### Positioning the Widget (language dropdown)
SiteTran automatically adds the language dropdown with the CSS “position: fixed;” to every page on your site, but you can also use the [sitetran_widget] shortcodes.

Instead of using the default “fixed” language dropdown, the [sitetran_widget] shortcode will generate the language dropdown wherever you position it on the page.

Note: You can currently only have one language dropdown per page, and you can style it however you want with CSS.

There are a few ways of adding the [sitetran_widget] shortcode to your site. You can add the shortcode to:

If you are unfamiliar with how shortcodes work, you can search on Google for “adding shortcode to wordpress”.

= Is it SEO compatible? =
Yes! 

We have a number of features that encourage search engines to index your translated content.

You can translate all metadata.
We automatically add hreflang tags and the global lang HTML attribute to each page for you.
We generate static translated pages that are stored in your database and delivered to your end users. (They are generated via our Translation Delivery Network).

= What is a Translation Delivery Network (TDN)? =
Translation Delivery Networks (TDNs) are rapidly becoming the mainstream way to deliver translated versions of your site to your end users, and especially to search engines.

The main advantage of this is that search engine bots will be able to find and index your translated content. Sometimes, when content is produced dynamically on the front end (the client side), search engine bots have a hard time finding it. With our TDN, you ensure that your translated content will be found.

= Will it work with my theme or page builder? = 
We work with all themes. Here are some popular ones: Astra, Hello Elementor, Twenty Twenty-One.

We work with all page builders. Here are some popular ones: Elementor, Divi, Visual Composer, WP Page Builder, Beaver Builder…

= Can I translate content produced by other plugins? =
Yes. Absolutely everything on your site can be translated. 

On top of producing static pages for your translated content via our Translation Delivery Network, you can also translate phrases that are dynamically produced by JavaScript on your frontend (the client site), which means that anything on the page can be translated. By default, SiteTran searches for missing translations every 500ms.

= Can I translate images? =
Yes!

SiteTran enables you to translate href and src attributes, which means that we can swap out your original images with their translated counterparts. Simply add the URL of your translated image as the translation for the original image's URL, and SiteTran handles it for you.

= Will my posts and pages be duplicated for every language? =
No.

We make it so that you don't need to unnecessarily create and manage lots of additional duplicate posts and pages in your WordPress dashboard for each language. Everything is handled by SiteTran!

= I have a lot of plugins. Will this slow down my site? =
No!

The SiteTran - Translate Your WordPress Site plugin is super fast and lightweight. It will not slow down your site, and in fact, users report that our translated pages are actually faster than the original language (because the translations are cached).

= Can I migrate from a different translation plugin to SiteTran? = 
Absolutely! You can reach out to us and we'll do our best to help you move your content over.

= Can I use SiteTran for more than one website translation? =
Yes! You can use SiteTran on as many websites as you want, but you should create a new site for each project. This will allow you to better organize your translated content, and keep your projects separate from each other.

You can share important resources such as Glossaries, Similar Phrases (Translation Memory), and other things across your different sites.

The more usage you have across all sites, the lower our prices get for you, which means you get to take advantage of our discounted pricing as your usage volume increases!

= Will I get more traffic with my new translations? =
Thanks to our SEO solutions, your translated content will show up on search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and more...

Your website will reach a wider, more diverse and multilingual audience.

= Where is my data stored? =
Your static translated pages are stored in your WordPress database, and your original phrases and their translations are stored in SiteTran's data centers. 

You own your content. We don't share your data with anyone unless you're using machine translation, in which case we need to send your phrases to our machine translation providers, DeepL and/or Google Translate, to get the translations.

= Does SiteTran provide support? =
Yes, we have a responsive support team. 

If you're having trouble using the SiteTran - Translate Your WordPress Site plugin, check out our help documentation.
